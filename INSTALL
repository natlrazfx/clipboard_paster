Installation and Usage Instructions

This script requires the PySide2 library. To install it, run the following command:
bash
pip install PySide2

Download or clone the clipboard_paster.py script
It is recommended to add this script to your .nuke/menu.py file for automatic loading. You can do this by adding the following line in .nuke/menu.py:

nuke.pluginAddPath('path_to_script_directory')
Replace path_to_script_directory with the actual path where clipboard_paster.py is located.

After setting up, restart Nuke.
The script adds a new menu command to Nuke under Edit > Paste Image from Clipboard.
You can also set the shortcut. By default Ctrl+Alt+V to quickly paste images or sequences from the clipboard into your Nuke project.
